# Libft

---

## 📝 Description

Libft is the first mandatory project of the **42 Common Core**.  
Its goal is to create a personal C library that replicates and extends essential standard library functions.  
This project introduces fundamental concepts such as:

- Low-level memory management  
- String and memory manipulation  
- Linked list handling  
- API design and modular programming  

The final product is a **static library (`libft.a`)** that can be reused in future C projects.
