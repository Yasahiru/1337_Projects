<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
ft_printf is a custom reimplementation of the standard C printf function. 
Its purpose is to handle formatted output by reproducing the behavior of the original function. 
This version includes support for several essential format specifiers and recreates core printf logic using variadic functions, 
without covering every feature of the real libc implementation.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p><strong>Compilation</strong></p>
<p>Run the following command to compile the project and generate the <code>libftprintf.a</code> static library:</p>
<pre><code>make</code></pre>

<p><strong>Integration</strong></p>
<p>To use <code>ft_printf</code> in your own programs, include the header file and link the library when compiling:</p>
<pre><code>#include "ft_printf.h"

cc yourfile.c libftprintf.a -o yourprogram
</code></pre>

<h2>Usage Example</h2>

<p>Below is a minimal example showing how to use <code>ft_printf</code> inside a simple C program:</p>

<pre><code>#include "ft_printf.h"

int main(void)
{
    ft_printf("Hello %s! The answer is %d.\n", "world", 42);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compile it together with the library:</p>

<pre><code>cc main.c libftprintf.a -o test_printf</code></pre>
